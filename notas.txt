Nginx fix for React Router
--------------------------
In the next lecture, we will be adding some Nginx config to the client-side project, but I neglected to add one line that would 
get the Nginx server to work correctly when using React Router!

In the client/nginx/default.conf file, please add the following line to the end of the location directive:

    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;

The default.conf should now look like this:

server {
  listen 3000;
 
  location / {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html index.htm;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }
}


Fix for Failing Travis Builds
-----------------------------
In the upcoming lecture, we will be adding a script to our .travis.yml file. Due to a change in how the Jest library works with Create React App, we need to make a small modification:

script:
  - docker run USERNAME/react-test npm test -- --coverage
instead should be:

script:
  - docker run -e CI=true USERNAME/react-test npm test
You can read up on the CI=true variable here:

https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests#linux-macos-bash

and environment variables in Docker here:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables

Additionally, you may want to set the following property if your travis build fails with “rakefile not found” by adding to the top of your .travis.yml file:

language: generic
